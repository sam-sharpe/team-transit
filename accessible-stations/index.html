        It has been three decades since the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed in 1990, but only a <a href="https://new.mta.info/map/5346" target="_blank">quarter</a> of the 472 subway stations in New York City are ADA-accessible. The
        Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) hopes to change that within the lifetime of their <a href="http://www.mta.info/press-release/mta-headquarters/mta-board-approves-historic-515-billion-capital-plan" target="_blank">Capital Plan</a>,
        which goes
        through 2024, by when they plan to have made 70 more stations accessible with an allotment of $5.2 billion.
        <br><br>
        The MTA’s goal at the end of the five-year plan is to make it so that no one is any more than two stops away from an accessible station. In compiling the data for the interactive below, reporters found that some lines had as many as 20 stops
        before an accessible station was reached. The G line in Queens and Brooklyn only has one accessible station in its entire 21-stop line.
        <br><br>
        Currently, getting around the five boroughs is a hassle for those with disabilities. Riders who are wheelchair-bound or may otherwise need elevators to access the subway have limited options when getting around the city.
        <br><br>
        In reality, the current MTA-designated accessible stations may not even be as accessible as they should be. Those who require ADA-compliant stations to travel require accessibility at both their origin station and their destination station.
        This results in a very complicated commute for many people with disabilities, considering only a quarter of stations are currently accessible. Of those stations, there are issues of some stations only being accessible in one direction and a
        lack of accessible transfers between the lines, not to mention broken elevators.

        According to disability rights activist Mary Kaessinger, who has Multiple Sclerosis, broken elevators are a common inconvenience for disabled New Yorkers. Her disability requires her to use a motorized scooter to travel, but the constantly
        out-of-service elevators make it hard for her to commute.
        <br><br>
        While celebrating her last birthday, Kaessinger had to continue on her subway line until she came across a stop that was ADA-compliant - that stop turned out to be in a completely different borough. “We couldn’t get out at Grand Central
        because the elevator was broken, so we went to the next station. It was also broken so we couldn't use it. So we had to go to the next stop which turned out to be in Queens,” said Kaessinger.
        <br><br>
        Kaessinger, 74, is part of the advocacy group Disabled in Action of Metropolitan New York which campaigns for the rights of disabled New Yorkers. The group fights to make the subway lines not only more accessible, but also fully and more
        commonly accessible, a big task considering the current convoluted system.
        <br><br>
        Due to the lack of full accessibility at each station, a person who requires accessible stations will have a much more prolonged commute than they would if stations were accessible. Kaessinger herself has to take a 20-minute bus ride from her
        home in Brooklyn to the closest accessible station, Prospect Park, to get anywhere using the subway.
        <br><br>
        Victor Calise, Commissioner of the Mayor’s Office for People with Disabilities, hopes to rectify that. Calise was nominated by Mayor Bill de Blasio to fill a vacant seat on the MTA Board. If elected, Calise would be the first person with a
        disability to serve on the board.
        <br><br>
        “There are no more excuses for building inaccessible infrastructure or designing processes that do not meet the needs of the disability community,” said Calise. “We need to make sure that the needs of people with disabilities are always at
        the forefront of everything the MTA is doing”
        <br><br>
        Jessica Van Dyck, a volunteer with Elevator Action Group, couldn’t agree more. She called the state of the New York City transit system “abhorrent,” and is hopeful that the appointment of Calise will expand the amount of accessible stations
        across the system.
        <br><br>
        “Visually having someone in the room that's in a wheelchair and knows what it's like to navigate the system in a wheelchair is important," said Van Dyck. "It's ludicrous that it’s taken this long to have a disabled person on the board.”
        <br><br>
        The MTA has previously said it hopes to create a fully accessible subway system by 2034, but the current state of the stations shows they have their work cut out for them. If work continues to happen at its current pace, at making 70 stations
        accessible every five years, the MTA will likely miss their target by a decade.
