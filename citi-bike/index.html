      <p>
        As New York City was placed under official lockdown orders on March 22, 2020, the patterns of how New Yorkers use its bike-sharing program Citibike changed.

        <br><br>
        An analysis of March data from Citibike finds that the number of rides decreased across all stations, for an average of -45.1%. The analysis compared the data from the first half of the month of March to the second half of March using March
        16 as the midpoint. The number of rides dropped dramatically in midtown Manhattan as business and commercial activity ground to a halt in that area. However, certain residential neighborhoods saw an increase in Citibike usage such as the
        Upper East Side in Manhattan and Bushwick and Ridgewood in Brooklyn.
        <br><br>
        The following map shows the percent change in rides using “start station data” - it includes only the number of rides that started at each station. You can click on any station in the map to see the station name and the percent change in
        rides. The color gradient is explained by the legend, which shows percent increases as a dark blue and percent decreases as a light blue.

        On March 25, Mayor de Blasio, NYC DOT Commissioner Polly Trottenberg, and Lyft unveiled the Citi Bike Critical Workforce Membership Program, providing the first-responder, healthcare, and transit workforce with a free month of Citi Bike
        membership. The program has since been expanded to offer a free full-year membership and include City employees and employees at food-related non-profits.
        <br><br>
        “Having seen higher demand for Citi Bikes near our critical hospitals, Lyft has arrived at a generous and creative plan that will help get first responders where they need to go,” said DOT Commissioner Polly Trottenberg. “I cannot thank them
        enough. If your job at the MTA, NYPD, FDNY or a hospital requires you to move around, I strongly encourage you to become a Citi Bike member — and take advantage of this means of transportation that is fast and convenient. In these difficult
        times, Citi Bikes — which are also being cleaned with increased regularity — allow riders to remain safe and socially distant.”
        <br><br>
        Data from March does not suggest a higher than average change in ridership at stations near hospitals such as:
        <li>W 34th Street & 11th Ave: Javits Center</li>
        <li>1st Ave & 68th Street: Weill Cornell Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</li>
        <li>1st Ave & 16th Street: Mount Sinai Beth Israel
        </li>
        <li>1st Ave & 27th Street: NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue</li>
        <li>1st Ave & 30th Street: NYU Langone Health</li>
        <li>10th Ave & 59th Street: Mount Sinai West</li>

        However, these effects may show up in April data and suggest further data analysis.
