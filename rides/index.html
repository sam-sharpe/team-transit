      <div class="headline">As subway ridership drops, NYC sees unequal changes across income and geography.

      <p>
        For this comparison we looked at the average ridership at each station on February 27th and March 27th. That was a Thursday and Friday, respectively. That day in February had ridership that was similar to the other days of the week before the
        decline took place. Beginning in March ridership dropped off very steeply and stayed low.
        <br>
        Not all neighborhoods saw the same changes in ridership. The top ten subway stations in neighborhoods with the highest income in NYC, all located in the financial district, saw declines in ridership double that of the city average.
        <br>
        The neighborhoods that actually saw the least decline in ridership were located in Brooklyn, upper Manhattan, and primarily in the Rockaways.
